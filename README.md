# UserFrontendNoptinApproved
This plugin extends the Noptin newsletter plugin by adding a new automation trigger that fires when a user's `wpuf_user_status` user meta is updated to "approved". This is particularly useful for WordPress User Frontend Pro (WPUF) users who want to send automated emails when a user's status is approved.
